# Sustainable-Food-Tracker
🧐 Problem Statement
In an age of heightened awareness regarding health and climate change, consumers are increasingly seeking transparency in the food they purchase. The modern grocery store environment is saturated with complex labels, marketing jargon, and ambiguous environmental claims that make it difficult to quickly and accurately assess a product's nutritional value and ecological impact. The challenge lies in providing immediate, understandable, and actionable data at the point of purchase. People want to know: "Is this healthy for me?" and "Is this good for the planet?" without needing a degree in nutrition science or environmental policy.

This lack of transparency often leads to uninformed choices that may negatively impact personal health and contribute to unsustainable consumption patterns.


💡 Solution

The Sustainable Food Tracker is a powerful web and mobile application designed to bridge this information gap. By leveraging the comprehensive, community-driven database of the OpenFoodFacts API, our platform transforms complex data into simple, digestible insights.

Users can instantly scan a product's barcode or enter it manually to retrieve vital information:

Nutritional Health Grade: A clear indicator of how healthy the product is.

Eco-Score: A transparent view of the product's environmental footprint.

Additive & Allergen Alerts: Warnings about specific ingredients.

CO₂ Impact Assessment: An evaluation of the product's contribution to climate change.

We provide clarity in an opaque industry, empowering users to make educated, sustainable choices in real-time.
